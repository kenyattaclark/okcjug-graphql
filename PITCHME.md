### Lions and Tigers and GraphQL (Oh My!)

<span style="color:gray">An introduction to GraphQL. A query language for your API</span>

---
### Why GraphQL?
---
### Requirements

Build a UI to show information about a Star Wars character.  For example, Darth Vader, and all the films this character appeared in. This view should display the charactersâ€™s name, birth year, planet name, and the titles of all the films in which they appeared.
---
### Sample Response
```
{
	"person": {
	"name": "Darth Vader",
	"birthYear": "41.9BBY",
	"planet": {
		"name": "Tatooine"
	},
	"films": [
		{ "title": "A New Hope" },
		{ "title": "The Empire Strikes Back" },
		{ "title": "Return of the Jedi" },
		{ "title": "Revenge of the Sith" }
	]
  }
}
```
+++
Assumming that we know the characters ID we might ask:
```
GET - /people/{id}
```
+++
The response may look like:
```
